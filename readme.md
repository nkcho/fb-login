# facebook login script
A simple session management system built on facebook authentication

To make it work for you :
- You will need an api_key and app_secret from facebook to add it to the fb-configs.php file on the path 'config/fb-configs.php'
(Given that this has been configured for this app, contact me chonkarimbi@gmail.com and I will give you mine so that it can work for this script without a problem)
- Host the downloaded files on the path: 'http://localhost/projects/facebook/fb-login/'
